# 100-days-of-code
100 Days of Code Challenge has been initiated by freeCodeCamp and Alexander Kallaway is doing awesome work for the good of community.


I am taking part in 100 Days Code Challenge at KIET MCA, where I would be posting my code at (https://lnkd.in/fnGGMY6) for next 100 days. This is my public announcement and now I would be doing code for at-least 1 hour daily."
