# 100 Days Of Code - Rules

## One need to follow following rules to stay in challenge

### 1: Share below line on your LinkedIn and FB account on day 0.
### "I am taking part in 100 Days Code Challenge at KIET MCA, where I would be posting my code at [Github Repo](https://github.com/chetanhere/100-days-of-code) for next 100 days. This is my public announcement and now I would be doing code for at-least 1 hour daily."

### 2: You need to code for 1 hour daily and need to update the log file for showing your progress. Log file sample is already there on github and you just need to edit your version of file.

### 3: You need to post the daily code on repository and need to share the link on Fb and LinkedIn with hashtag "100DaysOfCode" and hashtag "KIETMCA".
### Sample Update: "Day 4: I have build a basic Calculator and here is the link : https://github.com/chetanhere/100-days-of-code/code/day-4/calculator.js (hashtag)100DaysOfCode at (hashtag)KIETMCA".

### 4: Coding 1 hour daily is compulsory (no Sunday or any other off) and updating progress on social media is compulsory too.

### 5: One can take 3 days off and need to compensate those at end, so need to code 103 days then. No one is allowed to take 2 off regularly.
